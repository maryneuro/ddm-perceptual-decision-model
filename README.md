# Drift Diffusion Model (DDM)
Simulation and quick parameter fitting for perceptual decision-making.

This project implements a minimal Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) to simulate
evidence accumulation in binary decision tasks and estimate the drift parameter
using a simple grid-search approach.

## Overview

The Drift Diffusion Model is widely used in cognitive neuroscience to model
decision-making processes at the subject level.

This repository:

- Simulates trial-level evidence accumulation
- Generates decision times and binary choices
- Estimates the drift rate parameter
- Produces visual comparison between observed and fitted RT distributions
